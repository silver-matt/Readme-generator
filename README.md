# Professional README Generator Starter Code

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)
This project was to create a README generator that will display after answering prompted questions
I used node.js, fs, Inquirer, and npm to complete this task
The index file contains the questions to be filled in to generate the readme as well as linking the generateMarkdown file and requiring fs and inquirer.
the generateMarkdown contains the functions for inserting the licensing as well as the table of contents to populate the README with
It also uses the module.export function
